# MasterMind AI

This repository contains a simple implementation of a MasterMind solver using a genetic algorithm.

The code is divided into two sections: MasterMind modelisation, Genetic algorithm components

## Section 1: MasterMind modelisation

This section contains all the basic elements necessary to be able to play around with the general MasterMind game.

I won't go over the rules of the game, you can find them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29)

## Section 2: Genetic algorithm components

Again, this section contains basic genetic algorithm elments including the following:
* Selection
* Mutation
* Crossover
